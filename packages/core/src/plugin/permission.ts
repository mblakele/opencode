/**
 * Run a permission op against the Permission instance owning the session.
 *
 * Permission state is location-scoped while sessions (and their events) are
 * global: a request asked in another directory pends in that location's
 * instance, invisible to the caller's own `permission` service (whose lookup
 * then fails "not found"). Resolve the session's location first and use that
 * instance instead, like the HTTP session-location middleware does. Sessions
 * that no longer resolve fall back to the ambient instance (legacy behavior).
 *
 * Known limit: a request that pended before `session.move` stays in the old
 * location's instance while the session now resolves to the new one, so it
 * still reports not found (same move race as session forms). Migrating
 * in-flight permission/form state on move is future work; callers that need
 * it should reply before moving the session.
